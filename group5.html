          <h1>what is Gender Discrimination?</h1>
          <p>Gender discrimination is defined as any form of exclusion or limitation based on gender that prevents men, women, girls, or boys from realizing, recognizing, or exercising their full and equal rights as human beings.<p>
            
          <p>Gender inequality can harm society as a whole by promoting prejudices and denying people opportunities because of their gender.<p>
            <p>By Providing documentaries explaining the problem and how necessary gender discrimination is to be lessened or even better to be stopped and starting a campaign endorsing these solutions through social media.</p>

    </section>

  <section id="solution">
    <h1>Our solution to fullfil our Goal</h1>
    <p>We plan to make documentaries and implement it by posting it through social media.<p>
      <p>The documentaries should influence our audience into thinking the same.<p>
        <p>Creatively, these documentaries should be animated and should include the most lovable cartoon characters together with a message on the issue.<p>
          
         <p> Why would we choose to animate our documentaries? It can also teach children to learn respect at such a young age.<p>
           
            <p>How are Documentaries important/useful?  because they can educate us and change perspective’s  to the issues we might have not known or have been overlooked about.<p>
              
            <p>Why provide documentaries through the internet? Providing documentaries in social media benefits because 60.49% globally uses social media and when dcoumentaries about this issue is posted in the internet in can reach alot of people globally.<p>
              
              <p>Since this new generation uses technology we have seen that people get easily influenced through social media this is why we have thought of our documentaries solution.</p>
